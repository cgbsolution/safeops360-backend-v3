"""PTW closed-loop lifecycle endpoints.

The evidence-carrying transitions of the rebuilt permit state machine:

  POST /api/ptw/{id}/accept                       — receiver accepts (ISSUED → ACTIVE)
  POST /api/ptw/{id}/complete                     — work-completed declaration + outcome
  POST /api/ptw/{id}/withdraw                     — close out a NEVER-EXECUTED permit
  GET  /api/ptw/{id}/closure-gate                 — which close-out door is open
  POST /api/ptw/{id}/handback                     — handback inspection (ex site-verify)
  POST /api/ptw/{id}/cancel                       — operational cancellation
  POST /api/ptw/{id}/archive                      — retention flag on CLOSED permits
  POST /api/ptw/{id}/isolations/{iso_id}/verify   — lock-out confirmation (was a dead end)
  GET  /api/ptw/{id}/evidence                     — evidence timeline (detail page + report)

  GET/POST/DELETE /api/ptw/{id}/attachments…      — two-phase signed-URL uploads
                                                     (mirrors the incident pattern)

Every action persists a PermitActionEvidence row (GPS + photo + signature per
the policy in app/services/ptw_evidence.py) — that is the closed loop.
