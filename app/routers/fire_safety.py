"""Fire Safety & Emergency Response API (P1-4).

Equipment lifecycle, assembly points, emergency plans, drills (with the MAJOR_GAP
completion gate), the CAMS-engine inspection trigger (sourceModule='FIRE'), crisis
escalation and the FSER panel. Plant-scoped via QueryScope.

NB: gated by the FIRE licence module in the model (registry/editions); the router is
mounted always-on in dev because the unsigned dev licence predates the FIRE code —
add "fire_safety": "FIRE" to ROUTER_MODULE once a FIRE-inclusive licence is issued.

RBAC uses the dedicated FIRE.* grants (see services/fire_permissions.py and
prisma/seed-rbac.ts). The earlier INCIDENT.READ/UPDATE bootstrap is retired; it
had two live defects — auditors could not read the register they inspect, and
contractors could — both of which the FIRE grants close.

#   * AUDITOR and LEAD_AUDITOR hold no INCIDENT grant, so the roles whose job is

#   * WORKER and CONTRACTOR_WORKMAN hold INCIDENT.READ at OWN_RECORDS, which
