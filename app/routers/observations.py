"""Observations router. Vertical slice that demonstrates the full pattern
the other modules will follow:

  • authorize() at the top of every handler
  • plant-scope filter on list queries (via get_accessible_plants)
  • workflow engine kicked off on create
  • permission service consulted for both module action AND scope

This file is the template for porting the remaining 7 operational modules.
