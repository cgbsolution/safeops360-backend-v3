"""Fire checklist + extinguisher register API (PIL/EHS/CL 025-028).

Mounted on the same `/api/fire` prefix as `routers/fire_safety.py` — one module,
one URL namespace. Splitting it into its own file rather than growing
fire_safety.py past 1,500 lines is the only reason it is separate.

RBAC is per action, not a read/write pair: `FIRE.EXECUTE` fills a sheet,
`FIRE.VERIFY` reviews it, `FIRE.APPROVE` locks it, and those go to different
roles because the sign-off block printed on the client's own sheets says they
should. See services/fire_permissions.py.

Everything here is a thin HTTP shell over two services:

  • services/fire_checklists.py — period identity, run resolution, the
    Prepared/Reviewed/Approved chain, and the grid pivot.
  • services/fire_register.py  — the sixteen-column register projection and its
    due-date badges.

The routes deliberately hold no business rules of their own: the same "can this
be approved yet" answer has to hold whether it is asked from this router, the
seeder or a future scheduled job.
