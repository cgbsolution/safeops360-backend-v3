"""Overdue fire-checklist reminders and escalation.

WHAT RUNS THIS
--------------
`scheduler.py`'s existing asyncio supervisor, as the `fire_checklist_overdue`
job — the same mechanism already running `fire_equipment_status` nightly. No new
scheduling infrastructure: the supervisor already gives every job its own
session, a SystemActor for audit attribution, a JobRun record, run-now, and
misfire catch-up on boot. A second scheduler would have to reimplement all five.

Notifications go through `erm_notifications.create_notification`, which writes
the in-app `Notification` row AND fires a best-effort email. That is the
platform's existing channel pair; there is no WhatsApp integration here and this
does not add one.

THE ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM, AND WHY THIS DOES NOT GUESS
---------------------------------------------------
`FireEquipment.assignedTechnicianId` is new and null on every row. Nothing on
this platform has ever assigned a fire asset to a person — `maintenanceContractor`
is free text naming a company ("SafeFire Services Pvt Ltd" on 24 of 37 assets),
not a user.

So "notify the assigned technician" has no one to notify yet, and there are two
legitimate answers: a data-entry pass assigning real people, or a location-based
default resolving to whoever holds a maintenance role at that plant. Those give
different people different accountability for a missed statutory inspection, so
the choice belongs to the business owner, not to this module.

Until it is made, `UNASSIGNED_STRATEGY` defaults to `report`: the sweep records
the period as overdue and unassigned, sends no technician notification, and the
gap becomes visible on the asset and in the escalation to the EHS lead. It does
NOT silently pick someone — a reminder sent to a guessed recipient is worse than
one that says nobody is assigned, because it looks handled.

Setting `FIRE_REMINDER_UNASSIGNED_STRATEGY=location_default` switches to the
role-based fallback once that decision is made.

ESCALATION IS IN ADDITION, NEVER INSTEAD
-----------------------------------------
At due+N the EHS lead is told as well. The technician's own notification is not
withdrawn or superseded — an escalation that silently replaced it would leave
the person who can actually fill the sheet with no outstanding prompt.
