"""Auto-promotion path: a Near Miss with potentialSeverity = CRITICAL
on submission (or upgraded to Critical during joint review) is treated
as a High-Potential Near Miss and immediately spawned as an Incident
record in INVESTIGATION status. This is the most important capability
in the Near Miss module per the brief.

Public surface:
    promote_near_miss_to_incident(db, near_miss_id, *, actor_id) → str
        Creates the Incident, marks the NearMiss as PROMOTED, suspends
        the near-miss workflow (instance.status → 'AUTO_PROMOTED'),
        notifies Plant HSE Manager + Plant Head + Corporate HSE,
        returns the new Incident.id.

Idempotent: if the near miss already has promotedIncidentId set, the
existing incident id is returned without side-effects.
