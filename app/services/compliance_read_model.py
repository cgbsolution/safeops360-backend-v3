"""Checklist completion rate — ONE aggregation, two surfaces.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
Fire and Chemical checklist runs already ARE `CamsEngagement` rows carrying
`sourceModule='FIRE'` / `'CHEMICAL'` and a `periodLabel`. So completion rate is
an aggregation over tables that already exist; no separate read model, no
mirrored store, and nothing to keep in sync.

It is deliberately ONE function with two callers — the Compliance Snapshot
inside CAMS and the completion panel on the Operations side. Two
implementations of "completion rate" would drift, and the first anyone would
notice is an auditor being shown 82% on one screen and 91% on another for the
same asset.

THE DENOMINATOR IS WHAT IS OWED, NOT WHAT EXISTS
------------------------------------------------
The subtle failure here is counting engagement rows. A checklist nobody ever
opened has no engagement row at all, so `completed / rows_that_exist` scores a
site that did nothing as 100% — the most dangerous possible reading of a fire
compliance number.

So the denominator is derived from the cadence: for each asset, each APPROVED
template that applies to its type, each period overlapping the window, one
occurrence is owed. `periods_in_range` comes from the same frequency engine the
register grid and the reminder job use, so all three agree on what a period is.

"CANNOT BE COMPUTED" IS NOT ZERO
---------------------------------
`rate` is None when nothing was owed — no assets, no applicable template, or a
window before the register existed. It is NOT 0.0 and NOT 100.0. A site with no
fire assets has not failed its fire compliance and has not passed it; the
question does not apply. Every caller must render that as "no data", which is
the convention the Manhours/LTIFR fix established for exactly this reason.
