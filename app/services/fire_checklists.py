"""Fire checklist runs — periodic records on the CAMS engine.

The four Page Industries checklists (PIL/EHS/CL 025-028) do not get their own
store. `models/fire_safety.py` already fixed that policy — fire inspections are
CAMS engagements, "one engine, no parallel checklist store" — and this module is
the thin layer that makes CAMS behave like a *periodic register* rather than an
ad-hoc audit:

    template (CamsTemplate)  +  asset (FireEquipment)  +  period  ->  one run

The three things that layer has to add, and nothing else:

  1. **Period identity.** `CamsEngagement.periodLabel`, granularity-encoded, so
     "today's daily sheet for panel P" resolves to exactly one row. Auto-create
     on first touch, made race-safe by a partial unique index rather than by an
     application lock — two inspectors opening the same sheet at the same second
     is the normal case in a plant, not an edge case.

  2. **The sign-off chain.** Prepared -> Reviewed -> Approved, printed at the foot
     of every source sheet. Mapped onto the CAMS state machine rather than a
     parallel status column, so stage ORDER is enforced by the machine that
     already enforces it and there is one answer to "can this be approved yet".

  3. **The grid pivot.** The paper sheets print a month of daily inspections, or
     a year of monthly ones, as one page. That is a *view* over a set of period
     runs — see fire_checklist_templates.py for why the alternative (a response
     store keyed by item x date) is both a fork of the engine and a misreading of
     the document.

Deterministic and offline throughout: no external calls, no clock beyond
`datetime.now`, no AI.

# machine. Mapping onto it rather than adding a fourth status column means the
# existing `_TRANSITIONS` table is what rejects "approve before review" — one
# rule, one place.
#
# APPROVED lands on REPORT_ISSUED, not CLOSED, and that is deliberate. CLOSED
# runs `engagement_close_blockers`, which refuses to close an engagement with
# open findings. For a sheet whose only finding-raising item is the extinguisher
# refill-due check, that is the correct behaviour to keep — approving the record
# and closing out the defects it raised are genuinely different acts, and
# collapsing them would let a defect be signed away by the HOD approving the
# sheet it was found on. CLOSED remains reachable through CAMS once the findings
# are closed.
