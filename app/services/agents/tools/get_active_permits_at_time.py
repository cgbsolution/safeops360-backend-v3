"""Tool: get_active_permits_at_time.

Returns Permits that were ACTIVE (or in any approved-and-not-yet-closed
status) at a specific timestamp and plant. Used to answer: "what work
was being performed at the time of the incident, and was this incident
within a permitted activity vs. unauthorised work?"

A permit is considered active in the time window if:
  • validFrom <= ts < validTo (or closedAt if earlier)
  • status was ACTIVE or PLANT_HEAD_APPROVED (post-approval, pre-close)

We can't perfectly reconstruct historical status (would need an audit
trail). Approximation: the row's CURRENT status + the validity window.
For a recent incident this is accurate; for an incident from months
ago, the permit may have been closed since — that's surfaced via
closedAt.
