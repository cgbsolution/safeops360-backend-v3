"""Background job scheduler (P2-1) — dependency-free asyncio supervisor (no
APScheduler/Celery needed for the single-process on-prem deployment; mirrors the
existing _licence_recheck_loop pattern).

Every registered job:
  • wraps an idempotent service function
  • runs in its own DB session with a SystemActor (audit attribution + scoped jobs)
  • records a JobRun (RUNNING → SUCCESS/FAILED + summary + recordsAffected)
  • is callable on-demand (run-now) AND on its interval
Misfire recovery: on startup the supervisor reads the last successful JobRun per
job; an overdue job runs once (not N times).
