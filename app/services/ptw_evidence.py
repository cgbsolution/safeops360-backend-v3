"""PTW action evidence — closed-loop field proof for every permit action.

Every safety-relevant transition in the permit lifecycle (approve, accept,
suspend/resume/extend, work-completed declaration, handback inspection,
closure, cancellation, isolation verification) must carry field evidence:

  • GPS coordinates of the actor's device (+ accuracy when available)
  • a drawn signature (data-URL PNG)
  • one or more onsite photos, uploaded first via the PermitAttachment
    two-phase signed-URL flow and referenced by id
  • an optional declaration the actor confirms

The per-action requirements are POLICY, not hardcode — `EVIDENCE_POLICY`
below is the single place that says which action needs what. Validation
raises `EvidenceError` (routers convert to HTTP 422) so a client that
forgot GPS/photo/signature gets a precise, actionable message.

`record_action_evidence` persists the PermitActionEvidence row and links
the uploaded photos to it. Rows join the tamper-evident audit hash-chain
(registered in app.main) and are rendered as the evidence timeline in the
close-out report.
