"""Router → module map — the single source of truth for which API surface each
gateable module owns. main.py uses it to attach `require_module(...)` to every
gated router at include time, so the entitlement check is the API security
boundary (build prompt §5.2) regardless of how a route is called.

A value of None means CORE / always-reachable (identity, org, RBAC, workflow,
dashboard, licensing) — these are never gated so a client can never be locked
out of their own data or the renewal screen (§2.4, TL-14).

Keyed by the router's import name in app.routers (e.g. "ptw_active") to keep the
mapping declarative and reviewable in one place.
