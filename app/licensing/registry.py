"""Module Registry — the canonical, code-defined list of gateable modules.

This is the *vocabulary* every licence references. A licence can only enable
codes that exist here; the Licence Authority validates against it at issue
time and the validator resolves dependencies against it at runtime.

Two classes of module:
  * core (`is_core=True`)  — identity, org/site, RBAC, audit trail, the
    workflow engine, the dashboard shell, and the licensing system itself.
    These are ALWAYS enabled regardless of licence so a client can never be
    locked out of their own data / the renewal screen (build prompt §2.4, TL-14).
  * gateable (`is_core=False`) — everything a client actually buys.

`depends_on` lets a finer-grained module pull in its base. e.g. KRI depends on
ERM, so enabling KRI auto-enables ERM during dependency resolution — which is
also what lets us guard the shared erm_p2/p3/t3 routers on the single ERM code.
