"""Restrict "Schedule Audit" to HSE Manager + admins.

Raising an audit used to be gated on AUDIT_COMPLIANCE.CREATE, which nine roles
held. But CREATE also gates checkpoint-library import and template
custom-checkpoint authoring, so locking scheduling down by revoking CREATE
would have silently stripped content authoring from the audit roles too.

So scheduling gets its own permission, AUDIT_COMPLIANCE.SCHEDULE, granted to
HSE_MANAGER (own plant) and ADMIN / SYSTEM_ADMIN (all plants) and nobody else.
Everyone keeps CREATE and therefore keeps library/template authoring.

Widening this later is a tick-box in Configuration -> Roles: grant
AUDIT_COMPLIANCE.SCHEDULE to whichever role should raise audits. That is the
whole reason it is a named permission rather than a hard-coded role check.

Idempotent. Run from the backend root:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/restrict_audit_scheduling.py
