"""Seed the audit assignment pickers with a credible team at one plant.

The schedule wizard's four pickers are derived from RBAC scope (see
services/audit_assignment.py):

    Lead auditor / Co-auditor  -> AUDIT_COMPLIANCE.EXECUTE
    Plant manager (reviewer)   -> AUDIT_COMPLIANCE.APPROVE
    Auditee                    -> AUDIT_COMPLIANCE.UPDATE

Every slot already resolved to more than five people at Meridian North Works,
but almost all of them were ADMIN / SYSTEM_ADMIN accounts holding the
permission incidentally, while the actual audit personas (Anjali Verma, Lead
Auditor) were absent because the CAMS roles carried no AUDIT_COMPLIANCE grant
at all. Run scripts/grant_audit_compliance_cams_auditors.py FIRST — that fixes
the role→permission half; this script only does the user→role half.

What it adds: a PLANT-scoped UserRole for a handful of people whose day job is
already the audit function, so each picker shows a sensible team rather than
the administrators. Nothing is removed and nobody's primary role changes.

Idempotent — re-running makes no further changes. Reverting is a matter of
deleting the UserRole rows it prints. Run from the backend root:
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/assign_audit_role_scopes.py
